Here is your new task but first tell me how long it will take 
FIRST: Delete the existing dashboard, then update the Document Management and Billing tabs
Use the existing empty "Document" tab (rename to "Document Management" or "Documents & Records") and the existing empty "Billing" tab. Build clean, professional frontend modules:
1. Document Management System (rename existing Document tab)
•	Dashboard view showing: 
o	Document categories (Academic Records, Financial Documents, ID Verification, Foreign Credential Validation, Existing Credits/Transfer Records)
o	Upload area with drag-and-drop functionality with temporary file storage in browser cache/localStorage
o	Document list with columns: Name, Type, Upload Date, Status, Actions
o	Filter/search bar
o	Status indicators (Pending Review, Approved, Needs Attention)
•	File upload functionality: Store uploaded files temporarily in browser memory/cache (no backend needed) - files can be viewed/downloaded from temp storage
•	Color scheme: Professional blues/grays matching educational sector
•	Icons for different document types
•	Progress indicators for multi-step processes
•	Mobile-responsive layout
2. Billing System (use existing empty Billing tab)
•	Clean billing dashboard showing: 
o	Current balance/amount due
o	Payment history table
o	Upcoming payment schedule
o	Payment method selection (placeholder buttons for credit card, ACH, payment plan)
o	Invoice generation button
o	Simple payment breakdown (tuition, fees, credits applied)
•	Status badges for paid/pending/overdue
•	Clean receipt/invoice preview mockup
Design Requirements:
•	Modern, minimal interface (think Stripe or modern SaaS)
•	Consistent typography and spacing
•	Clear call-to-action buttons
•	Logical navigation between modules
•	Professional color palette suitable for higher education
•	Use Tailwind CSS or similar for clean, maintainable styling
•	Include placeholder data to show how populated views look
Note: Files uploaded will persist in browser cache during the session for demo purposes.
Focus on user experience and visual hierarchy. Make it look production-ready with functional file upload/preview.
