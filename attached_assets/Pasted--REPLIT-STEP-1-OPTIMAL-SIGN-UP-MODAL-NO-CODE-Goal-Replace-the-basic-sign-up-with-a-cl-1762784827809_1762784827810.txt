## REPLIT — STEP 1 (OPTIMAL SIGN-UP MODAL, NO CODE)

**Goal:** Replace the basic sign-up with a clean, modern modal. Keep existing login behavior. No Supabase calls yet.

### A) Trigger & Container

* “No account? Create one.” opens a centered modal with backdrop.
* Modal must trap focus, close on [X], Esc, or backdrop click.

### B) Fields (required unless marked optional)

1. **Full name**
2. **Email**
3. **Password**
4. **Confirm password**
5. **I agree to the Terms of Service** (checkbox)

   * Link text: “Terms of Service” (opens in new tab).

*(Optional later: Phone number, Preferred language.)*

### C) Labels / Placeholder Text

* Full name — placeholder: “e.g., Daniel Lumiere”
* Email — placeholder: “[name@example.com](mailto:name@example.com)”
* Password — placeholder: “Minimum 8 characters”
* Confirm password — placeholder: “Re-enter password”
* TOS — label: “I agree to the Terms of Service”

### D) Buttons

* **Primary:** “Create account”
* **Secondary (text):** “Cancel” (closes modal)

### E) Validation Rules (client-side, no server calls)

* Full name: not empty, ≥ 2 chars.
* Email: valid email format.
* Password: ≥ 8 chars.
* Confirm password: must match Password.
* TOS: must be checked.
* Show inline error under each failing field; disable primary button while errors exist.

### F) Submit Behavior (demo phase)

* On valid submit:

  * Save **email** to local storage (same key the login uses).
  * Close modal.
  * Redirect to **/dashboard**.
* Do **not** write to Supabase yet.
* Clear field values after close.

### G) UX Details

* Autofocus **Full name** when modal opens.
* Enter key submits when fields valid.
* Prevent body scroll while modal is open.
* Keep error messages short (one line).

### H) Accessibility

* Modal has a title “Create your account” with `aria-labelledby`.
* Focus moves into modal on open, returns to trigger link on close.
* Inputs have explicit `<label>`s.

### I) Acceptance Criteria

* Opening “Create one.” shows the modal with all fields and TOS checkbox.
* Invalid inputs show inline errors; “Create account” stays disabled until valid.
* On success, email is stored locally, modal closes, user lands on **/dashboard**.
* No Supabase/network calls occur during sign-up.
* Existing login (any email → dashboard) remains unchanged.
