Here’s *exactly* what to do — copy-paste steps only:

1. Go to [https://replit.com/~](https://replit.com/~).
2. Click **Create Repl**.
3. In the search bar, type **React** and pick the template called **React (Node.js)**.
4. Once it opens, look at the file tree on the left → open the **src** folder.
5. Find the file **App.jsx** (or **App.tsx** if it’s TypeScript).
6. Delete everything inside that file.
7. Copy ALL the code from here (the entire Roadmap Screen V1) and paste it inside **App.jsx**.
8. Click the green **Run** button at the top.

✅ The Student Roadmap app will appear on the right side.

If you see it running fine and looking good, click the **Deploy** button (top-right in Replit), choose **Static site**, then click **Deploy Now** to publish your app and get a public link you can share.
